# JSMinna Frontend Task3

As frontend developers, we don’t only work on the JavaScript side of things, but it is also required of us to be able to comfortably replicate a design using HTML and CSS.

This task would be focused on combining what you’ve learnt in the previous task with emphasis on your HTML and CSS skills.

Todo
Pick one of the following landing pages and replicate them (the instructions on how to get the assets and colors can be found on each page)

Depending on the link you decide to work with, modify your login and signup page to match the look and feel of the site. That is the buttons, the colors, the font type should be the same.
This submission would contain 3 files, the index.html which is the landing page you choose, the signup.html and login.html which is the updated signup and login page
Solutions should be pushed to github and the hosted github pages link should be submitted

Note
Your site should be responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop and extra large screens
